My name is Hoa Phan, born in 1993.
At the end of 2015, I started to work in Mobile programming when I remember most of the applications were developed in Objective C and Java, until 2017 when React Native started to bloom in Vietnam and I also try and Build my first application, so far I have more than 5 years of experience in React Native, and I also have more than 1 year of experience working with Python Django.
